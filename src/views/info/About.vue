            PTR@LCO is a new education project designed to extend the education
            programs at Las Cumbres Observatory by offering a self-paced
            laboratory based course entitled "Astronomy and the Scientific
            Method" aimed at grade levels 5-8 but accessible by learners of all
            ages.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The course is supported by a brand-new telescope network of similar
            scale to the Las Cumbres Observatory with a focus on remote and
            scheduled usage, in contrast to purely robotic usage, with a more
            heterogenous range of telescopes (from 200mm to 24‚Äù) and detectors
            (CMOS and spectrographs), in contrast to the homogenous
            instrumentation of LCO.
