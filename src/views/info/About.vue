          PTR@LCO is a new education project designed to extend the education
          programs at Las Cumbres Observatory by offering a self-paced
          laboratory based course entitled "Astronomy and the Scientific Method"
          aimed at grade levels 5-8 but accessible by learners of all ages. The
          course is supported by a brand-new telescope network of similar scale
          to the Las Cumbres Observatory with a focus on remote and scheduled
          usage, in contrast to purely robotic usage, with a more heterogenous
          range of telescopes (from 200mm to 24”) and detectors (CMOS and
          spectrographs), in contrast to the homogenous instrumentation of LCO.
